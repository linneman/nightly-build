          <h2>Connecting an external REPL</h2>

          <p>As we explained in detail in the Online REPL section, the cornerstone
            of  program development  in the  Clojure programming  language and  most
            Lisp  dialects is  the so-called  REPL. In  addition, there  are further
            supporting  functions  such  as  syntax  highlighting,  special  editing
            functions such as paredit, functions for debugging, code navigation, and
            fast retrieval  of documentation. All these  functionalities are usually
            combined in an integrated development environment, whose capabilities go
            far  beyond the  inline  editor and  online REPL  provided  by the  bond
            server.  In addition,  these  systems  allow to  extend  the server  and
            client implementation  of the  Bond System  itself. For  the development
            of  more  complex  build  descriptions,  the  use  of  such  an  IDE  is
            therefore  imperative. In  the  following we  introduce  the three  most
            important of these development environments.  They all use the so-called
            <a href="https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.6.0/index.html">nREPL protocol</a> as
            interface to the Clojure runtime system.</p>

          <h3>Emacs</h3>
          <p>The   <a  href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>   text
            editor is by far the oldest  and most widely used programming system for
            application  development in  the  programming language  Lisp. Emacs  was
            developed more  than 30 years ago  and was mostly implemented  in a Lisp
            dialect  itself,  which  explains  its wide  distribution  in  the  Lisp
            community. Also the  first development tools for  Clojure were initially
            implemented for Emacs.  For these reasons Emacs offers  the best support
            for software development projects in Clojure.</p>

          <p>Another major  advantage is that  Emacs is the only  system mentioned
            here that does not require a graphical user interface and can be used in
            plain text mode. If network bandwidth  or resources are limited this can
            be  very  advantageous as  Emacs  can  be  run  directly on  any  remote
            system.</p>

          <p>But Emacs also  has significant disadvantages. Since  the software is
            much  older than  all  modern graphical  user  interfaces, its  standard
            operating  concepts  are  not  supported   throughout  or  not  at  all.
            Users  therefore  have  to  relearn  most  of  the  basic  functions  of
            the  editor.  Most  of  the  Emacs  functions  are  also  controlled  by
            special  key   combinations  which  neither  correspond   to  the  usual
            key  combinations  of  today's   graphical  operating  systems  nor  are
            favourable  from  an  ergonomic  point   of  view.  The  latter  is  due
            to  the  fact   that  in  the  early  stages  of   Emacs  development  a
            <a   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard">different
              keyboard layout</a>  was used  which has long  been forgotten.  In fact,
            Emacs is considered largely
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9257677/emacs-annoying-key-combinations">
              unusable with its default configuration</a>!</p>

          <p>You should be aware of these problems when choosing Emacs. Of all the
            IDE's discussed here,  Emacs is the most  flexibility and extensibility.
            There  is  hardly a  feature  that  cannot  be reconfigured.  There  are
            also  a  lot  of  extensions  available  which  especially  improve  the
            problem of complicated keyboard shortcuts.  Users familiar with the text
            editor  <a  href="https://www.vim.org">Vi</a>  are  recommended  to  use
            the  <a  href="https://evil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html">evil
              extension</a>   which   makes  most   of   the   shortcuts  used   under
            Vi   available   in   Emacs   as   well.   The   Emacs   derivative   <a
                                                                                    href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">spacemacs</a>  has  the plugin  'evil'
            preinstalled. So  the learning curve  should be  steep, at least  for vi
            users.</p>

          <p>When    you    decide    for    Emacs,   you    should    at    least
            install   the  plugins   <a  href="https://cider.mx">Cider</a>   and  <a
                                                                                    href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode">Clojure    Mode</a>
            since   these   are   essential   for   all   Clojure   development   in
            Emacs.   Refer    also   to    the   excellent   instructions    of   <a
                                                                                    href="https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs">Clojure  for  the  Brave
              and True</a> about how to use Emacs for Clojure development.</p>

          <p>As one of the first projects of the free software movement, Emacs and
            all  plugins  are  available  for  free  under  the  free  GPL  software
            license.</p>

          <table class="doc-image">
            <caption align="bottom">Fig 1: Clojure Development under Emacs</caption>

          <p>Bond automatically starts  a nREPL server on local TCP  port 7888. To
            connect Emacs  to a running  Bond instance, press M-x  cider-connect and
            specify  'localhost' under  Host  and '7888'  under  Port. For  security
            reasons  nREPL  session can  only  be  opened  locally. However,  it  is
            possible to  access the nREPL port  via ssh port forwarding  even from a
            remote  machine.  The  port to  be  used  can  be  changed in  the  file
            <i>~/.nightly-build/local-settings.clj</i>, which  is created  the first
            time the bond server is started.</p>

          <h3>Eclipse</h3>
          <p>Besides Microsoft Visual Studio, which  is not recommended for use on
            Unix respectively GNU/Linux systems,
            <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>
            is the
            <a href="https://pypl.github.io/IDE.html">most widely used IDE today</a>.
            The plugin
            <a href="http://doc.ccw-ide.org/documentation.html">Counterclockwise</a>
            offers relatively good Clojure support.</p>

          <p>Note  that although  Counterclockwise is  still fully  functional, it
            does not  appear to  be currently actively  maintained. Also,  since the
            concept  of  workspaces takes  some  getting  used  to by  newcomers  to
            Eclipse,  this  plugin  is  only  recommended  for  experienced  Eclipse
            developers.</p>

          <p>Both   Eclipse    and   the   Counterclockwise   plugin    are   free
            software   and   can    therefore   be   used   free    of   charge   in
            commercial   environments.  The   source   code  is   available  at   <a
                                                                                    href="https://github.com/ccw-ide/ccw">Github</a>.</p>

          <table class="doc-image">
            <caption align="bottom">Fig 2: Eclipse with Counterclockwise</caption>
            <tr><td><img src="img/eclipse_ccw.png"></td></tr>
          </table>

          <p>The figure above shows the Counterclockwise Clojure plugin configured
            for  the usage  with the  Clojure programming  language. You  can easily
            connect Eclipse to a running instance of Bond by selecting the pull down
            menu 'Window',  'Connect to REPL'  and specify for host  'localhost' and
            for port 7888.</p>

          <h3>IntelliJ IDEA</h3>
          <p>The  third  development  environment,  which  we  will  only  briefly
            discuss  here,   is  <a  href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ
              IDEA</a>  from JetBrains.  Similar to  Eclipse,  it is  mostly used  for
            the  development  of  software  written  in  Java,  but  numerous  other
            programming  languages  are  also supported.  For  software  development
            under  Clojure  and  Clojurescript  there   is  the  very  extensive  <a
                                                                                    href="https://cursive-ide.com/">Cursive</a> plugin.</p>

          <p>Unlike  the Clojure  extensions  for Emacs  and  Eclipse, the  plugin
            Cursive is not free software. There is a so-called 'free license', which
            can  be downloaded  free of  charge. However,  Cursive is  not available
            in  source code,  nor  does  the license  allow  commercial  use of  the
            software.</p>

          <table class="doc-image">
            <caption align="bottom">Fig 3: IntelliJ IDEA with Cursive</caption>
            <tr><td><img src="img/intellij_cursive.png"></td></tr>
          </table>

          <p>As  you can  already guess  from the  screenshot above,  IntelliJ and
            Cursive offers superior features that go far beyond the functional range
            of  Counterclockwise.  In  contrast  to  Counterclockwise,  this  plugin
            also  seems to  be much  better integrated  into the  latest version  of
            IntelliJ.</p>

          <p>Cursive      allows      also      to      use      various      REPL
            connections     and     configurations.      Refer     to     the     <a
                                                                                    href="https://cursive-ide.com/userguide">Cursive  documentation</a>  how
            to do this.</p>

          <h3>Alternatives</h3>
          <p>There are much more than the development systems shown here. However,
            we have limited  ourselves to the three most commonly  used platforms in
            the previous illustrations with Emacs, Eclipse and IntelliJ.</p>

          <p>But we  should at  least mention the  <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom
              Text  Editor</a>  developed   by  the  Github  team  which   aims  at  a
            similar  extensibility   as  Emacs   and  relies  on   web  technologies
            from   scratch.   Atom   is   free  software   and   offers   with   the
            plugins   <a  href="https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl">Proto-Repl</a>,
            <a   href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-paredit">paredit</a>   and   <a
                                                                                    href="https://atom.io/packages/parinfer">parinfer</a> quite good clojure
            support.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, <a  href="https://sekao.net/nightcode">Nightcode</a> and
            <a   href="http://lighttable.com">Lighttable</a>  are   two  development
            environments especially designed  for Clojure, which both  focus on easy
            learnability. There are also a number of other systems and plugins. The
            page <a href="https://www.slant.co/topics/11929/~ide-for-clojure">slant.co</a>
            gives a good overview about most of them.</p>
