          <h2>Creating Build Descriptions</h2>
          <p>In  essence, a  build description  consists of  two parts.  First the
            individual build steps  are processed sequentially on  the build machine
            which is  usually but not  necessarily remotely controlled via  a secure
            shell (ssh) connection. Secondly, after successful processing or in case
            of an error,  a termination handler always executes one  command line on
            the  local shell  and an  additional support  function which  takes over
            logging, sending status e-mails, etc.</p>

          <h3>The Build Step</h3>
          <p>One build step is described  by the following three parameters which
            are stored within a Clojure vector as indicated in the following:</p>

          <font size="5"><pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">[:identifier-key "remote shell command string" timeout]</pre></font>

          <p>The  <i>identifier</i> is  used to  associated a  label to  the given
            build  step. This  is displayed  on  the status  page. In  case a  build
            step  failed it  allows  to immedially  track in  which  step the  error
            occured.</p>

          <p>The  <i>shell command string</i>  is executed  on the  build
            machine. It  uses the syntax of  the system shell on  this machine. Most
            GNU/Linux systems either use
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash">bash</a> or a variant of
            <a href="https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/ash">Almquist Shell</a>.
            Both are and widely compatible to each other.</p>

          <p>The last parameter  <i>timeout</i> specifies when a  shell command is
            expected to  be completed. When this  value is exceeded, the  command is
            interrupted and an error is assumed.</p>

          <h3>The Task List</h3>
          <p>The builds  steps are declared within  Clojure's <i>List Sequence</i>
            as indicated in the following example:</p>

          <font size="4"><pre class="prettyprint lang-clj linenums">
(list
  [:cleanup
   (format
    "rm -rf %s"
    dev-build-root) 120]
  [:init
   (format
    "mkdir -p %s"
    dev-build-root) 10]
  [:fetch
   (format
    (lstr
     "cd %s &&"
     "repo init -u %s -b %s -m %s &&"
     "repo sync -q -j 4 2>&1")
    dev-build-root
    manifest-url manifest-repo-branch dev-manifest) 7200]

  ;; further steps ...

  [:anything-changed?
   (format
    (lstr
     "cd %s && if [ -f no_changes ]; then"
     "  echo 'no new changes' > nightly.log;"
     "  exit 1;"
     "fi")
    dev-build-root) 10]

  ;; further steps ...

)</pre></font>

          <p>Let's  have closer  look what  these  do in  the aboves  hypothetical
            example.</p>

          <p>At first within the build step <i>cleanup</i> the directory where the
            build takes place is completely removed. We use the Linux
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rm_(Unix)">rm</a>
            command for this.  The parameters 'rf' specify that  the directory shall
            be removed recursively with all of its  contents in a forced way that is
            without asking for confirmation prompts.</p>

          <p>The directory name which is going to be removed is declared via a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string">format string</a>.
            This concept is mostly known from  the C programming language but widely
            used in other programming languages as well. Clojure offers the
            <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/format">format</a> function
            which does the  same. Its first argument is the  so called format string
            where template arguments  such as '%s' are replaced  by their associated
            parameters. Here the template character 's' indicates that the parameter
            is  of  the type  string.  The  used paramter  <i>dev-build-root</i>  is
            declared outsite of the definition of the <i>task list</i> and discussed
            later.</p>

          <p>The  remove  operation  can  consume a  significant  amount  of  time
            depending on the  amount of data to be removed.  We declare a relatively
            long timeout value of two minutes for this reason.</p>

          <p>The second build step <i>init</i> just  creates a new and empty build
            directory in the same manner.</p>

          <p>The third build step <i>fetch</i> is  used to clone all of the source
            code from the source code management system. Here the
            <a href="https://source.android.com/setup/develop/repo">repo</a> command
            is used to  clone from numerous git repositories. Since  the commands to
            be  used are  highly project  dependend, the  syntax of  the <i>repo</i>
            command is  not discussed in  detail here.  This example is  intended to
            illustrate something else instead:  Actually the build step <i>fetch</i>
            invokes three shell commands which  are separated by the '&&' operators.
            Since the <i>repo</i> command needs  to be executed within the directory
            <i>dev-build-root</i> we  have to set  the current working  directory to
            this location by invoking the shell command <i>cd</i> with the directory
            name  as parameter  first. Afterwords  <i>repo</i> is  called twice  and
            creates  its  output  content  inside  the  specified  build  directory.
            The  example illustrates  how  several shell  commands  can be  executed
            sequentially in one shell instance.  Such sequences can be consisted out
            of much more commands.</p>

          <p>To improve  readability, we  use the  function <i>lstr</i>,  which is
            provided  in file  the <i>server/utils.clj</i>  and combines  individual
            strings into one long string. This allows us to write the shell commands
            which  are  actually  used  on  the build  server  to  compile  all  the
            components  of  a  complex  software system,  push  build  artefacts  to
            production servers, etc. line by line  such that they can be immediately
            identified  by  a distinctive  color  assigned  by the  editor's  syntax
            highlighting  extension.  In the  example  above  the character  strings
            rendered in green are executed on the build server.</p>

          <p>The fourth build step in this example is used to identify whether new
            changes to  the code base  have been introduced. Only  in such a  case a
            build process is  started. Otherwise when the  file <i>no_changes</i> if
            present in the build directory of the remote machine, we return an error
            code  to  interrupt  all  further  build  steps.  Its  the  job  of  the
            termination handler  to correctly  propagate the  results which  will be
            explained in the next section.</p>

          <p>The build instructions in the example above come from the application
            for which this software was originally developed and can be found in the
            file  <i>ltenad_config.clj</i> which  is included  in the  bond software
            framework  for illustration  purposes. In  the given  and the  following
            examples the instructions have been slightly simplified. We recommend to
            have a  closer look to  the file <i>ltenad_config.clj</i>  to understand
            bond's full potential.</p>

          <h3>The Termination Handler</h3>
          <p>The termination  handler is  always invoked  at the  very end  of the
            build process. It comes with a similar format as used previously for the
            declaration  of one  build  step.  The main  difference  is  that it  is
            executed on the the same (local)  machine where the bond build server is
            running. This allows to generate  and process useful information such as
            in example  automatically generated software version  identifiers, fetch
            build errors and log files, etc.</p>

          <font size="5"><pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">[:identifier-key "local shell command string" timeout :term-cb callback-function]</pre></font>

          <p>For  more complex  functions such  as sending  out status  emails the
            optional  key value  pair <i>term-cb</i>  allows to  specify a  callback
            function  which  is  invoked  after the  termination  handler  has  been
            completed. We will illustrate how it  works with the example in the file
            <i>sample_config.clj</i>:</p>

          <font size="4"><pre class="prettyprint lang-clj linenums">
[:cleanup
  "echo 'do the cleanup'" 20
 :term-cb ;; clojure handler for sending status email
  (fn [session error]
           (let [{:keys [build-uuid build-name]} session
                 current-task (-> session :current-task deref)
                 sw-version "v1.2.3"
                 anything-changed? (not= :anything-changed? (:id current-task))

                 [subject mail-txt]
                 (if anything-changed?
                   (if (empty? error)
                     [(format "nightly build %s, sw version %s successful!" build-uuid sw-version)
                      (format (lstr
                               "Dear Colleagues,\n\n"
                               "This message is to inform you that the nightly build %s, sw version %s\n"
                               "has been successfully compiled:\n\n"
                               "The following changes have been introduced:\n\n"
                               "%s")
                              build-uuid sw-version changelog)]
                     [(format "nightly build %s, sw version %s failed!" build-uuid sw-version)
                      (format (lstr
                               "Dear Colleagues,\n\n"

                               "failed within the build task %s with the following error:\n\n"
                               "Error: %s\n\n"
                               "The following changes have been introduced:\n\n"
                               "%s")
                              build-uuid sw-version (:id current-task) error changelog)])
                   [(format "no changes detected in nightly build %s" build-uuid)
                    (format (lstr
                             "Dear Colleagues,\n\n"
                             "There have been no new changes discovered within the nightly build %s.\n")
                            build-uuid)])]
             [(if (= error "processing stopped!")
                0
                (sendmail *email-build-status-recipients* subject mail-txt))
              (hash-args sw-version changelog anything-changed?)])))]</pre></font>

          <p>In this sample  code it is assumed that the  software version and the
            changelog are present.  The associated information must  be generated by
            the  build process  itself respectively  by  parsing some  of the  build
            artefacts as  a result of this  process. For an example  how to generate
            this information refer  to the implementation of the  provided real life
            configuration file  <i>ltenad_config.clj</i>. Instead  you find  here in
            lines  7 and  9 bindings  to constants  strings for  simplification. The
            actual cleanup  handler in  line two  just prints  out a  status message
            using the <i>echo</i> command which is executed on a local shell.</p>

          <p>The callback handler is more  complex. Three cases are distinguished:
            First,  no changes  have  been  discovered, so  nothing  has been  done.
            Second, the  build has  been completed  successfully and  third, changes
            have been identified but the build failed.</p>

          <p>The  associated  information  is  provided via  two  input  variables
            to  this  function.  The  variable  <i>error</i>  provides  a  potential
            error  string.  When  it  is  empty,   it  is  assumed  that  the  build
            has  been  successfully  completed.  All  other  information  about  the
            given  build  process  is  provided via  the  hash  map  <i>session</i>.
            This  is  a  relatively  complex structure  which  is  generated  within
            the  function   <i>create-build-session</i>  which  can  be   found in the
            file<i>server/build_task.clj</i>. However, the implementation details do
            not need to  be considered further here.  All we need is  to extract the
            proccess  state of  the  current task  which  is done  in  line 6  which
            dereferences a so called <a href="">Clojure Atom</a> used to mange state
            in Clojure. From the identifier of the last process state, which will not
            change anymore  because the build  process is already terminated,  we can
            conclude whether anything changed which is  the case when we do not find
            the associated process state in line 8.</p>

          <p>With  this information  we  are  able to  generate  the subjects  and
            message contents for the given three cases to be used for a status email
            about the given build.  This is realized within the linex  10 to 34. The
            status email is only sent out in  case the build has not been stopped to
            because software  teams are  usually not  interested in  temporary build
            results.</p>

          <p>Finally  the information  we used  for the  generation of  the status
            email is returned back to the  bond server implementation and used there
            to update  the web  page where  the status  information about  all build
            processes is  displayed. The return  value is  a vector where  the first
            entry  is always  the error  code of  the termination  callback function
            where  the  value zero  indicates  that  no  error occured.  The  second
            argument  is  an  hash-map  with  optional  but  nevertheless  important
            information about the software version of the given build, the changelog
            which has  been introduced to  it and whether  or not anything  has been
            changed. The webinterface  will create status entries only  in case that
            new change has been introduced which is indicated by setting the boolean
            variable <i>anything-changed</i> to true.</p>

          <p>The <i>hash-args</i> function acts as a shortcut to generate the hash
            map:</p>

          <font size="5"><pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">{:sw-version sw-version :changelog changelog ...}</pre></font>

          <p>It    is   based    on    a   macro    definition    in   the    file
            <i>crossover/macros.clj</i>  and simplifies  the generation  of hash-map
            where provided value shall  be used as keynames as well.  You can try it
            out in the repl by evaluating the following test expression:</p>

          <font size="4"><pre class="prettyprint lang-clj linenums">
(let [sw-version "1.2.3"
      changelog "my change log"
      anything-changed? true]
  (hash-args sw-version changelog anything-changed?))

-> {:sw-version 1.2.3, :changelog my change log, :anything-changed? true}</pre></font>

          <h3>Bringing it all together, Build Descriptions and the Crontab</h3>
          <p>We   have   seen   how   build   steps   and   termination   handlers
            are   structured.  Now   we   will   show  how   to   embed  them   into
            generation   functions.   In   fact   two  of   them   are   used.   The
            function create-build-steps-&lt;xyz&gt;  creates a data  structure which
            includes  the  build  steps  and  termination  function  for  the  build
            &lt;xyz&gt;.  The  function  create-build-description-&lt;xyz&gt;  calls
            create-build-steps-&lt;xyz&gt;  and is  used  to incorporate  additional
            build  parameters such  as branches,  build directory  names, etc.  This
            allows to parameterize different build types e.g. for different hardware
            platforms, software versions (development, release) etc. in a simple way
            without having to repeat all build instructions.</p>

          <p>The  following  explanations  refer  to  the  supplied  example  file
            <i>sample_config.clj</i>,  which  can be  executed  directly  in a  Unix
            environment.  It  is  recommended  that you  also  familiarize  yourself
            with   the   implementation   of  our   first   practical   application,
            <i>ltenad_config.clj</i>   which   cannot   be  executed   outside   our
            organization as well.</p>

          <h4>Build Descriptions</h4>
          <p>Let's start with the function <i>create-build-description-sample-1</i>:</p>

          <font size="4"><pre class="prettyprint lang-clj linenums">
(defn create-build-description-sample-1
  []
  (let [build-machine {:host "localhost" :port 22}
        work-spaces "/mnt/ssd1/ol/nightly-builds"
        build-name "build-example"
        current-task (atom nil)
        date-str (get-date-str)
        build-uuid (str build-name "_" date-str)
        build-dir (str work-spaces "/" build-name "/" date-str)
        log-dir (str (System/getProperty "user.home") "/nightly-build-logs")
        _ (mkdirs log-dir)
        build-log-filename (str log-dir "/nightly_" date-str ".log")
        change-log-filename (str log-dir "/changelog_" date-str ".log")
        version-filename (str log-dir "/version_" date-str ".log")

        env (hash-args build-name build-uuid build-machine work-spaces build-dir
        current-task
        build-log-filename
        change-log-filename version-filename)]
    (merge env (create-build-steps-sample-1 env))))
          </pre></font>

          <p>This function  invokes in line  20 <i>create-build-steps-sample-1</i>
            which    creates   and    returns   the    <i>task-list</i>   and    the
            <i>termination-handler</i>   using   the   keys   <i>task-list</i>   and
            <i>terminate</i> within the  returned hash-map. This is  merged with the
            hash-map <i>env</i> which provides  crutial parameters which describe on
            which machine the build is executed, in which directory the commands are
            invoked, what  logfiles to be used  and so on. Most  of these parameters
            will  be  more  or  less  present  in  every  application,  some  as  in
            example the  reference to  version and  changelog files  are application
            dependend.</p>

          <p>Note, that  the current date  and time  is appended to  the universal
            identifier  of the  build (build-uuid),  the build  directory, changelog
            and  version  files  which  ensures  that every  build  gets  an  unique
            identification and  is not overwritten  by future builds.  For debugging
            purposes it is sometimes helpful  to declare a constant date-time string
            in line 7  which allows to restart a newly  created build sequence again
            in an existing build directory.</p>

          <p>In line  3 we  declare the  hostname and port  of the  remote machine
            where all build steps are executed on. Its required to use
            <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/passwordlessssh">public key based authentication</a>
            because it  will be  impossible to authenticate  via password  for every
            build step otherwise. You should make sure that this works by typing the
            following  line on  a  shell on  the  local Unix  system  where Bond  is
            running:</p>

          <font size="4"><pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">ssh -p 22 localhost "ls /"</pre></font>

          <p>If you  are asked for a  password, public key authentication  did not
            work. Otherwise you  will get a list  of files of the  root directory of
            the local machine.</p>

          <p>In line 11 we ensure that a directory where all logfiles are stored
            does exist. Otherwise this directory is created.</p>

          <h4>Generation of Build Steps</h4>
          <p>The  construction  of  the  task list  and  the  termination  handler
            has  already been  explained.  Now  we will  show  how these  structures
            are  parameterized  and   embedded  in  a  build   description.  In  the
            example   shown   here,  the   basic   structure   of  the   <i>function
              create-build-steps-sample-1</i> looks like this:</p>

          <font size="4"><pre class="prettyprint lang-clj linenums">
(defn create-build-steps-sample-1
  "build steps creation example"
  [{:keys [build-name build-uuid build-machine work-spaces build-dir
           current-task build-log-filename change-log-filename version-filename]}]
  (let [cleanup-script (-> "cleanup.py" get-resource quote-string-for-echoing)

        task-list
        (filter
         identity
         (list
         ;; task list elements
         ;; ...
         ))

         terminate
         [:cleanup
          "echo 'do the cleanup'" 20
          :term-cb ;; clojure handler for sending status email
          (fn [session error]
            ;; termination handler definitions
            ;; ...
            )]]
    (hash-args task-list terminate)))
          </pre></font>

          <p>The  <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/filter">filter</a>
            function  from  Clojure's  core  namespace which  is  invoked  in  lines
            8  and  following  is  only  used here  as  a  placeholder.  Its  second
            function  argument defines  which  elements are  filtered  out when  its
            invocation with a  given element returns logical false.  The function
            <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/identity">identity</a> simply
            returns  any   given  argument.  This   allows  us  to   easily  disable
            certain  elements   in  a  task   list  by   enclosing  it  by   the
            <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/comment">comment function</a>
            whose return value nil is equivalent  to logical false and therefore the
            commented  out element  is  in fact  filtered out  from  the task  list.
            Without the filtering we would end up with nil elements in the task list
            wich should be avoided.</p>

          <p>Filtering   can  also   be  realized   by  replacing   the  predicate
            <i>identity</i>  in  line   9  with  a  conditional   expression  as  in
            example:</p

          <font size="5"><pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">#(= (first %) :second)</pre></font>

          <p>This will  filter out all items  from the task list  except the build
            step <i>:second</i>. These options for filtering specific items from the
            task list can be very useful for development and debugging purposes.</p>

          <p>The  function   <i>function  create-build-steps-sample-1</i>  expects
            as  sole   input  parameter  a   hashmap  whose  key  value   pairs  are
            associated  with   all  required   build  paramteres  which   have  been
            generated in  the the  function <i>create-build-description-sample-1</i>
            which   we    already   discussed.   Within    line   3   and    4   the
            entries   of   this   hashmap   are    extracted   by   so   called
            <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/destructuring">desctructuring</a>. This
            allows to  directly create bindings between  the keys and the  values of
            the build parameter hash map which we can later use in the generation of
            the task list and the termination handler.</p>

          <p>The return value is generated by reverse process where we construct a
            hash  map  from the  provided  local  variables.  It contains  only  two
            elements, the <i>task list</i> and the <i>termination handler</i>. As we
            have already seen,  these are combined with the other  parameters in the
            function create-build-description in a hash map data structure. </p>

          <h4>The Cron Table</h4>
          <p>This   data  structure   is   usually   created  immediately   before
            starting  the  build.  In  our  application,  it  is  triggered  usually
            time-controlled overnight.  The start times  are defined in  a so-called
            <i>cron  table</i>,  which  is  based  on the  nomenclature  of  the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron daemon</a>   used  under
            Unix.</p>

          <p>The  <i>crontab</i>  also  provides  a  list  of  all  extings  build
            descriptions  which do  not necessarily  always  have to  be started  by
            <i>cron</i>. Instead they can be started respectively restarted manually
            via the web interface or  triggered externally by sending the associated
            http  post request.  So  the <i>crontab</i>  informs  users which  build
            descriptions  are present  even if  all  of its  elements are  disabled.
            We  explain  its  structure  using  the  real  life  configuration  file
            <i>ltenad_config.clj</i>:</p>

          <font size="4"><pre class="prettyprint lang-clj linenums">
(def cron-build-descriptions
  [{:m 0 :h 00 :dom false :mon false :dow false :desc create-build-description-mdm9607-bl2_2_0}
   {:m 0 :h 05 :dom false :mon false :dow false :desc create-build-description-mdm9607-bl2_2_0-quectel}
   {:m 0 :h 20 :dom false :mon false :dow false :enabled true :desc create-build-description-mdm9607-bl2_0_1}])
          </pre></font>

          <p>In the given example three different build jobs are defined which all
            end up using the same task list  definition. As we can see, the variable
            <i>cron-build-descriptions</i> is  a vector in  which each element  is a
            hash-map that contains  a build description. An entry  can be completely
            disabled if the  value for the key <i>:enabled</i> is  set to false. The
            entry for the  key <i>:desc</i> contains the generator  function for the
            respective build description.</p>

          <p>The remaining  parameters describe  the respective  times at  which a
            build  is started.  In  the  given example  these  are  at midnight,  at
            5:00  a.m.  in the  morning  and  at 8:00  p.m.  in  evening by  setting
            the  keys <i>:m</i>  for the  respective  minute and  <i>:h</i> for  the
            respective hour.  The additional keys  <i>:dom</i> (day of  month, range
            1-31), <i>:mon</i>  (the numeric  value for the  month, range  1-12) and
            <i>:dow</i> (the numeric value for the  day of week (range 1-7) allow to
            further restrict  the set of start  times. When they are  set to logical
            false  all values  apply and  the build  is triggered  every day  at the
            specified hour and minute as in the given example.</p>

          <p>The variable  <i>cron-build-descriptions</i> is thus  the fundamental
            basic definition of all build descriptions  and the only symbol that the
            bond  server actually  references from  the namespace  server.config. In
            principle, users are free to change  all other definitions as they wish,
            but we recommend following the given examples.</p>
